# TwitterTrendsSentiment

This project takes the trending topics for a specific location and analyzes related tweets 
for their sentiment regarding the trending topic. 

We utilize Google's Maps Javascript and Natural Language Process APIs to streamline the analysis process.
We also use Twitter's API to gather trending topics in a specific location.
These APIs give us quick and easy access to information on how people are tweeting and whether or not they 
"approve" of the trending topic
